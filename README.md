# HerbX-Insights

Accurate identification of Ayurvedic herbs is crucial for their appropriate use in
traditional medicine, but manual identification can be challenging and prone to errors.
Additionally, there is a vast amount of Ayurvedic knowledge dispersed across
numerous articles, making it difficult to access and utilize effectively. The research
aims to develop a comprehensive solution for accurate Ayurvedic herb identification
and knowledge management by integrating image recognition and text mining
techniques. Firstly, Herb Image Recognition leverages Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) like Densenet121 and Resnet50 to accurately classify Ayurvedic
herbs from images. This novel approach significantly enhances herb identification,
benefiting both practitioners and researchers. Secondly, Ayurvedic Text Mining
involves collecting a comprehensive corpus of Ayurveda articles. The collected data
undergoes preprocessing, including techniques such as tokenization, stopword
removal, and lemmatization. Subsequently, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is
applied to identify and extract key entities, encompassing herbs, symptoms, and
treatments. The summarized information is then utilized to create concise and
informative representations, which are efficiently grouped and stored in a MySQL
database for streamlined retrieval and analysis. The integration of image recognition
and text mining provides a holistic solution. The utilization of advanced CNN
architectures guarantees precise herb classification, whereas the scalable text mining
pipeline ensures effortless access to invaluable Ayurvedic insights. This research sets
the foundation for digitizing traditional practices and advocating evidence-based
herbal medicine.
